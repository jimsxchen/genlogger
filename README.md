Introduction
============
Setting up logging in python application can be quite tedious and complex. This library provides an easy way to set up for application within the package for all main app and submodules. It has two modules: j_logger and j_heartbeat.

j_logger is a generic module for setting up the loggers for the whole application (including both main app and sub-modules) in a hierachy way. It simplifies the setup and logs the message with full information such as date time in iso format, module name, function name and line number, and logging level of the calling module.  

j_heartbeat provides a heartbeat logging for any forever loop, either process or thread to present a keep alive message in the log. The heartbeat rate is user configurable.


Installation Instructions
=========================
From PyPi with pip:

```
pip install jlogger
pip install --upgrade jlogger
```
Installation from source code is straight forward:

```
python setup.py install
```

Detail Explanaton and Usage - j_logger
======================================
This module provides a single function (set_logger) to wrap up the nitty-gritty setups for named loggers within the application hierachy. The application can call this many times to set up different handlers as requested. Once set, it will direct the logging message to all handlers. The default handler is a rotating file handler which will rotate when the log file reaches the specified maximum size (default to 50MB) so would not fill up the disk. It also sets a pre-difined formatter in the root logger which the user can alter it if needed.

- Let's get hands on. Example:

Assuming an application package has the following structure:

```
my_app/
    __init__.py
    main_app.py
    submodules/
        __init__.py
        module1.py
        module2.py
    test/
        unittest.py
```

In the main_app.py 

```
import logging
from jlogger.j_logger import set_logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

......
if __name__ == '__main__':
    ......
    set_logger("main_app.log")     
    logger.info("*** Main app started ***")
    ......
```

In submodules module1.py and module2.py


```
import logging   
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    ......
    logger.info(f"Raw data received.")
    ......
    logger.warning(f"Temperature too high.")
    ......
```


- Explanation

In the main_app, it sets up a root logger and logs all messages (including the submodules) to the "main_app.log" file. Different module will have its own name in the log message. The logged message format looks like below:
```
         date time        module name   func:line No. level   message
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2022-03-03 14:43:25,926 — main_app.py — main_loop:153 — INFO — Waiting for communication to be connected.
......
2022-03-03 14:43:26,014 — module1.py — start:130 — DEBUG — Opening serial connection successfully.
```

The default root logger level is set to "DEBUG", rotating file handler, maximum file size is 5MB, the default rotating file number (rotate_num) is 1. All these settings can be changed by passing the name/value pairs. See below prototype for more details. 

When the live log file reaches 5MB, it saves it to a backup file the same name as the live one but with suffix of ".1". When the live log reaches 5MB again it overwrites (replaces) the backup file and so on so the log file size is capped to maximum 2*5MB.

If the user wants different logging level for submodules, can set this in the main_app after the set_logger call. Example:

```
    logging.getLogger('submodules.module1').setLevel("INFO")    # remember the default root log level is DEBUG!
```

The set_logger function can be called many times to set up different handlers as required. So the log can be saved to the file, and sent via an email or to the cloud for e.g.


- The prototype:

```
def set_logger(file_name:str, handler:str="rotatingfile", level:str="info", max_size=1024*1024*50,
                rotate_num=1, logger_name=None, propogate=True,
                host="localhost", port="51000", 
                mailhost=None, fromaddr=None, toaddrs=None, subject=None, 
                url=None, 
                queue:queue=None):
```

Where:
```
    :param file_name: the logger file name from the app 
    :param handler: the type of the handler. default to rotatingfile. It can also be:
                timedrotatingfile, watchedfile, socket, datagram
                syslog, smtp, http, buffering, memory, queue
                Note: each type has different argument set and has to be provided properly 
    :param level: The logging level for the root logger. Value needs to be in ["CRITICAL", "ERROR", "WARNING", "INFO", "DEBUG"]
                If the specified is not in the list, INFO is the default
    :param max_size: This argument is for rotating logs to specify the maximum log size. In mega byte.
    :param rotate_num: For rotating logs only. It specifies how many backup file needed. The value has to be
                at least 1 to work with rotation
    :param logger_name: named logger if provided, otherwise set up the root logger
    :param propogate: decide whether the logger can propogate to ancestors 
    :param host: For socket, datagram, http types of logger to specify the host name or IP address 
    :param port: For socket, datagram, http types of logger to specify the port number
    :param mailhost: For smtp type to set up the mail server
    :param fromaddr: For smtp type to set up the mail sender address
    :param toaddrs: For smtp type to set up the mail recipient address
    :param subject: For smtp type to set up the mail subject
    :param url: For http handler to specify the website url
    :param queue: For queue handler to pass a queue object

    return: the configured logger
```



Detail Explanaton and Usage - j_heartbeat
=========================================
The module provides a class to allow the user to use it in any forever loop (main while true or even thread) to log a heartbeat message something like below to indicate the process/thread is alive:

2022-03-03 14:43:41,060 — main_app — log:24 — INFO — Heart beat ----- alive. Logged every 5 seconds.

It takes care of the time expiration check according to the specified interval. If interval is set to 0, nothing happens.


- Example:

```
import logging   
from jlogger.j_heartbeat import HeartbeatLog   
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

......

heartbeat = HeartbeatLog("my_module", "5")
while True:
    ......
    heartbeat.log(logger)
```

Note, the heartbeat.log function has two extra arguments, "message" and "replace" (see prototype below). "message" default value is None. "replace" default is False. If "message" is not None, the log will either append (replace=False) the message to the pre-defined log message or replace (replace=True) the pre-defined according to the replace setting.

- The class prototype


```
class HeartbeatLog:
    def __init__(self, name, interval_env:str):
        """ constructor
        :param name: The forever module name passed from app
        :param interval_env: interval for the heartbeat log (must be a string). When it is set to 0, it won't log the heartbeat.
        """

    def log(self, logger:logging.Logger = None, message = None, replace = False):
        """ log function
        :param logger: The underlying logger. If this is None, it won't log.
        :param message: customised log message to attach or replace depending on the replace setting
        :param replace: replace the default message with customised one if set to True       
        Note, if interval value is 0, it won't log.
        """
```
